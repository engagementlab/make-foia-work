            You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. You can create anything that makes you happy.

            We'll do another happy little painting. Let's have a little bit of fun today. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.

        <p>Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Every day I learn. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>
